# public-demo-code
Code demos for public sharing
This repo is for sharing code samples related to past, published, or some versions of unpublished work. Versions of code included here will be edited for broad understanding as examples of my past work, as executable jupyter notebooks wherever possible. Code related to my thesis work and related publications will be made public in separate repos close to publication time, or shared with collaborators.

# Updates
May-June 2022: Edited image_analysis_code for readability by general scientific audience, with extensive README.

11/30/22: I successfully defended my PhD! Not many code updates around this time.

8/13/22: Added code samples for image analysis: image pre-processing macro in FIJI and analysis code for the resulting data after cells have been counted (manually in FIJI or with CellProfiler software).

## Upcoming updates
- Add other macros to image_analysis_code for processing different types of input images
- Upload code for microscopy image generative model (as jupyter notebook)

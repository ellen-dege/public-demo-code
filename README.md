# public-demo-code
Code demos for public sharing

## August 2022
This repo is for sharing code samples related to past, published, or some unpublished work. Versions of code included here will be edited for broad understanding as examples of my past work, as executable jupyter notebooks wherever possible. Code related to my thesis work and related publications will be made public in separate repos close to publication time.

### 8/13/22
Added code samples for image analysis: image pre-processing macro in FIJI and analysis code for the resulting data after cells have been counted (manually in FIJI or with CellProfiler software).

### Upcoming updates
- Create README for image_analysis_code providing context on full image analysis pipeline (for laminar quantification), for non-experts
- Upload code for microscopy image generative model (as jupyter notebook)
